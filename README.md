<h1>canvasgauge.js </h1>

This is a library I made to display sensors data on hardware projects. 

Currently there only 2 types of gauges: needle gauge, and rectangle bar (horizontal movement).
 
I'm planning to make some more type and enabled css to modify the gauges look

Here is a live demo <a href="http://lazychino.github.io/canvas_gauge/">http://lazychino.github.io/canvas_gauge/<a/>
